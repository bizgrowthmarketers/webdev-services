1. CLONE the repository
2. Always "Fetch origin" before starting to work, so you have the updated/latest code
3. Don' forget to create Feature/Section branch you are working on prefixing your name. ex. name-navbar  name-feature-cards  name-issue#1
4. Make a First Pull Request. Practice, so we can see if everything is running smooth. I, myself is not that versed in github. Write you name below in collaborators, then push to development branch then make a pull request

*note
If you accidentally started making changes in the development branch and now want to move those changes to a new branch, you can do so without losing any of your work. 
1. Create a New Branch: run in the console:  ```git checkout -b name-feature/section```
2. If you haven't committed your changes yet, you can commit them now:  ```git add .``` , ```git commit -m "Describe your changes"```
3. Switch back to the development branch: ```git checkout development```
4. Remove the changes from the development branch: ```git reset --hard HEAD```
5. If the changes were committed in development branch, use: ```git reset --hard origin/development```
6. Update in Slack if it doesn't goes well.
